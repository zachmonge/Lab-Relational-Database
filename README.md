# Lab-Relational-Database

This repository contains the script and diagram used to create a lab-wide relational database. Right now it is just being used for one study, which is called ERDeg. To create the database I used SQLite and specifically sqlite3, which is the Python implementation of SQLite. I am not able to make the data publically available because it contains participants' personal information.
